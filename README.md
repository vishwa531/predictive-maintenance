# Predictive Maintenance Project

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project focuses on predicting equipment failures using machine learning techniques. The goal is to anticipate when a machine is likely to fail so that maintenance can be performed in advance, reducing downtime and cost.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- Python (for data preprocessing, modeling)
- MATLAB (for visualization and dashboard)
- Random Forest Classifier
- MATLAB Drive (for storing and sharing files)
- MATLAB App Designer (for interactive dashboard)

## ðŸ§  Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature engineering)
- Model training and evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)
- Predictive insights and alerts
- MATLAB dashboard for visual monitoring

## ðŸ“Š MATLAB Integration
The final visualization and monitoring dashboard is developed in MATLAB. All relevant `.fig`, `.mat`, and `.mlapp` files are saved in the `matlab/` directory. 

> Make sure to open the `.mlapp` file in MATLAB App Designer to view the interactive dashboard.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

### Python Part:
1. Install requirements (if any):  
  pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run preprocessing and training:
```bash
python scripts/preprocessing.py
python scripts/train_model.py
```
MATLAB Part:
Open MATLAB.

Navigate to the matlab/ folder.

Open and run dashboard.mlapp in App Designer.
